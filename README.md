### Hi there 👋
I study & do NLP, I have been most interested in speech processing but my recent focus has shifted back to text classfication.

#### News, pending paper & projects

It is yet another online Zoom semester. 

__WS21/22__ is about algorithms, open competitions, automatic solution to statistical text classification, open-source projects and ethical discussions in NLP.

* A paper on solutions to PCL (patronizing & condescending language) detection coming soon... _(SemEval2022-task4)_

* _"Where would you start and what solutions are there to try for binary text classification (more specifically in the genre of toxic language: hate speech, PCL and ect..)?"_ The project will come with a tutorial review & example code off the shelf for use

* Meanwhile cracking Leetcode problems, will be sharing my solutions here soon...
