### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I study & do NLP. 

My research interests (topics I have been working on and wish to continue working with):

* __Toxic language detection__ (mostly hate speech and PCL) and corresponsing data annotation, __social media analysis__

* __Speech Processing__ (ASR, speaker identification/verification, etc.)

* __Multi-modal learning__: integrating visual/medical/physiological features and natural language to train models for various purposes (e.g. image-based NER, Document AI, VLN, Early Sepsis Prediction based on vital signs and clinical notes)

* __Bias and Ethical considerations with LLMs__ such as BERT and ChatGPT

* __Model generalizability__ to out-of-distribution data (invariant learning):
  
  * Evaluation beyond conventional metrics based on benchmark datasets: model significance, validity and reliability
  
  * Invariant Risk Minimization

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I recently wrote a short review on __text-based \& image-based NER__. \[[pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TvvJaq2yK0qPxE2RNb0_O2y_me5b82xS/view?usp=sharing)\]
