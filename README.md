### Hi there 👋
I study & do NLP, I am most interested in speech processing but my recent focus has shifted back to text classfication.

#### News, pending papers & projects

It is yet another online Zoom semester. 

__WS21/22__ is about algorithms, open competitions, automatic solution to statistical text classification, open-source projects and ethical discussions in NLP.

* JD at SemEval2022 Task 4: RoBERTa vs Traditional Ensemble Models for Patronizing and Condescending Language Detection.

* How much hate with #china? Analyzing China-related hateful tweets two years after the Covid pandemic 

* Meanwhile cracking Leetcode problems, will be sharing my solutions here soon...
