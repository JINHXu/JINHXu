### Hi there 👋
I study & do NLP, recently most interested in Speech processing. <br>
I train machines to listen, understand and talk. <br>

<br>
我的目标是让机器成精<br>
<br>


_It is very unfortunate I recently became a jobber, most of my recent work is not open-source not on GitHub.<br>
Stay tuned for the next open-source app..._


About me:<br>
born 11.11.1998<br>
徐帅呆，九八年光棍节生人。<br>
（我现在想改名叫徐大条）
